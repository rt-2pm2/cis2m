# Paper archive: replication instructions for paper examples
Each folder contains instructions on how to replicate the results presented in our works. Notice that the code used for `CDC19`, `HSCC20`, and `ACC21` is outdated and only here for completeness and result replication. For the latest code refer to the [main page](https://github.com/janis10/cis2m). 

Case studies for `arXiv2021` to be added soon.
